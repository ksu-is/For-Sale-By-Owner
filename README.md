# For-Sale-By-Owner
For Sale By Owner is a filtering sales app to make selling personal items and vehicles easier and less time consuming. This concept is based on my experience with trying to sell my car on Facebook Marketplace, which was frustrating and tiresome. I was selling a personal vehicle and got at least 40+ messages per day about the availability of my car. I also received extremely low offers even though the selling price was listed in the ad. I was bombarded with questions about the car that were clearly answered by my ad, which proved that people did not actually read the ad. This application would make human interaction a minimum and allow less stress on selling a personal item. The app would be able to set parameters by the owner on the saleâ€™s restrictions. For instance, you could set a minimum offer and if the potential buyer offered less than this amount, their inquiry would be not be sent to the owners inbox. This application would also let other buyers know the current offer so as to eliminate non-serious buyers. Overall, this program would allow only serious buyers to be able to talk to the seller, which will expedite the process and create a stress-free selling experience.
