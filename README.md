# For-Sale-By-Owner
For Sale By Owner is a filtering sales app to make selling personal items and vehicles easier and less time consuming. In my personal experience in trying to sell my car on Facebook Marketplace was very frustrating and tiresome. I was selling a personal vehicle and got at least 40+ messages per day about the availablility of my car. I also got extreemly low offers even though the selling price was listed in the add. I also got lots of questions about the car that were clearly answered by my add and yes people did not actually read the add. This application would make human interaction a minimum and allow less stress on selling a personal item. This app would be able to set parameters by the owner on things like minimum offer and if the person offered lower than minimum offer they would be not be forwarded to the owners inbox. This application would also let other buyers know the going offer so as to eliminate non-serious buyers. This would narrow down real serious buyers to only be able to talk to the seller, this will expedite and create a stress free selling experience.
